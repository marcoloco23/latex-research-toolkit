# Reference Papers Directory

Store PDF files of important research papers here for AI reference and citation.

## Organization

```
references/
├── key_papers/           # Most important papers (3-5 core references)
├── related_work/         # Papers for literature review
├── methodology/          # Papers describing methods you're using
├── datasets/            # Papers describing datasets
└── background/          # General background/survey papers
```

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names that match your bibliography keys:
- `smith2023_example_research.pdf` (matches `@article{smith2023example}`)
- `johnson2022_foundations.pdf` (matches `@book{johnson2022foundations}`)

## AI Integration

When an AI assistant needs to reference papers:
1. Check this directory for relevant PDFs
2. Use the filename to find the corresponding entry in `latex/references.bib`
3. Ensure citations are properly formatted
