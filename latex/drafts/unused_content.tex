\section{Alternative Approach (Draft)}
This was an initial approach that didn't make it into the final paper but might be useful later.

\subsection{Preliminary Results}
Some early experiments that didn't pan out:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First attempt at solving the problem
    \item Alternative methodology that was too complex
    \item Results that were interesting but not central to main argument
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extend the approach to larger datasets
    \item Investigate multi-modal applications
    \item Compare with other baseline methods
\end{enumerate}

% \section{Removed Section}
% This entire section was removed from main paper due to space constraints
% but contains valuable content for follow-up work
