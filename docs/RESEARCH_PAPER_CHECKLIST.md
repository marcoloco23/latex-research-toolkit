Writing an Original Physics/Math Research Paper: The Ultimate Checklist

Writing a successful research paper in theoretical physics or mathematics requires careful planning, originality, and clarity. The goal is to present something truly novel – a previously unknown result – along with a clear argument and context ￼. Below is a step-by-step outline (a to-do list) for developing and writing a high-quality, focused research paper that addresses a genuine research gap and meets the standards of top journals.

1. Choose a Focused Research Topic and Identify a Gap

Begin by selecting a narrow, well-defined topic within physics or math that genuinely interests you. Survey the broad area to spot unanswered questions, inconsistencies, or unexplored connections. Your aim is to pinpoint a research gap – something important that has not yet been solved or explained. This gap will form the basis of your research question. Remember that the best papers tackle a specific problem rather than trying to cover an entire field. (For example, in 1905 Einstein published four separate papers on distinct problems rather than one massive treatise ￼, demonstrating the power of focus and brevity in communicating breakthroughs.) By keeping your scope focused, you set yourself up to make one clear, novel contribution instead of a vague summary of many topics.

2. Conduct a Thorough Literature Review

Once you have a potential question or topic, perform an in-depth literature review to understand what’s already known and what has been done by others. Read recent journal articles, arXiv preprints, and classic papers related to your topic. This step helps you refine the research gap: you need to verify that your idea hasn’t been done before and identify how your work will build on or diverge from prior results. Take careful notes on each relevant study, and pay attention to any shortcomings or open problems those papers mention. A good literature review ensures you give proper background and context in your paper – as a reader will want to know “What was already known in this field? Where did this problem come from?” ￼. By the end of the review, you should be an expert on the state of the art in your niche and be confident that your planned research will fill a genuine gap in knowledge.

3. Formulate a Clear Research Question or Hypothesis

With the context in hand, define the exact question your paper will answer or the precise claim you will investigate. This research question or hypothesis should directly address the gap you identified. Make it as specific and focused as possible. For example, instead of aiming to “study quantum gravity” (too broad), you might ask, “Does applying Technique X resolve the inconsistency between Theory A and experimental result B in quantum gravity?” A targeted question will guide your research and keep the paper tight. At this stage, also articulate what’s new about your approach or answer. Ask yourself questions like: “Am I strengthening or generalizing a previous result? Am I applying a new method to an old problem? Am I connecting two previously unrelated theories?” ￼. This helps ensure your work has a novel angle. Essentially, you should be able to finish the sentence: “In this paper, we address the unresolved issue of ____ by doing ____, which has not been done before.” This will later become the core message of your introduction.

4. Ensure Originality and Narrow the Scope

Before diving into the work, double-check that your idea is truly original. It’s crucial that your paper presents previously unknown results ￼ – something new to science, not just a rehash or minor variation of known facts. If someone else has partially answered your question, refine or narrow it further to highlight a unique aspect. It can help to discuss your idea with a mentor or colleagues to verify its novelty. Also, narrow the scope of your paper to a manageable size. Aim to make one main point or discover one “dramatic” result rather than trying to solve multiple big questions at once. Top physics journals like Physical Review Letters expect a single significant result in a short paper (they have a ~4-page limit for Letters) ￼. In fact, PRL and similar journals seek “brief accounts of highly important original research” ￼. This means your paper should be laser-focused on a single message. If you find you have enough material for two distinct papers, then plan to write two papers rather than merging them. Many great scientists followed this approach: for instance, each of Einstein’s 1905 papers tackled one key idea in a concise manner ￼, and Stephen Hawking’s famous discovery of Hawking radiation was first announced as a short two-page letter ￼. Keeping the scope tight not only helps in clarity but also increases the impact of each paper by not diluting the message.

5. Plan the Research Methodology

With your question defined, decide how you will answer it. In theoretical physics or math, this might involve formulating a model, deriving equations, or developing a proof. Outline the steps or techniques needed to reach the result. For example, determine which existing theories or mathematical tools you will use, and whether you need to develop any new techniques. If your work is more theoretical, you might be planning a series of logical deductions or calculations; if it’s mathematical, perhaps you’re proving a new lemma en route to a theorem. Sketch a rough plan: “First, I’ll assume X and derive Y. Next, check consistency with Z,” and so on. This plan is essentially the blueprint of your argument. It’s also wise to identify what evidence or examples will support your claims (e.g. a special case computation, a diagram of a theoretical model, or a computational simulation for verification). Having a clear methodology plan will guide your research process and later form the basis of the paper’s “Methods” or theoretical framework section.

6. Carry Out the Research and Obtain Results

Now, do the work. Perform the calculations, prove the theorem, or carry out the experiment (if any). This is where you make the actual scientific discovery that your paper will report. It may involve weeks or months of effort working through equations or logic. Make sure to document your process and results carefully. As you obtain results, continually check that they indeed answer your research question. This stage may involve some iteration – you might discover you need to adjust your approach or even refine the question. Don’t start writing the paper until this research is substantially complete and you have a clear main result in hand. As one writing guide notes, the decision to write should come “after a clear result is obtained” ￼. Writing too early can lead to a vague or unfocused paper; instead, you want to be certain of what you’re reporting. If the result is not what you expected, that’s okay – you can still write a strong paper about it, as long as it’s new. The key is that by the end of this step, you have something novel and solid (a proven theorem, a derived formula, a confirmed theoretical prediction, etc.) that forms the centerpiece of your paper.

7. Verify the Results and Novelty

Before writing, take a moment to validate your findings and their originality. Double-check all derivations or calculations for errors. It can be helpful to have a colleague review your math or logic. Ensure that your result actually supports your claims. This is also a good time to do a final literature check: has anyone published something similar very recently? Make sure no one has scooped your discovery. If your result is truly new, you should also be able to explain why previous approaches didn’t find it – this reinforces its novelty. Sometimes, presenting your results informally (within your research group or at a seminar) can reveal if others find it convincing and new. Such feedback can be invaluable. By the end of this verification, you should be fully confident that when you claim a new result, it is genuinely new and correct. This will allow you to write with authority and clarity.

8. Outline the Paper’s Structure

Now that you have your results, create an outline for your paper before jumping into writing full text. Scientific papers generally have a logical structure that changes little over time ￼. For a theoretical physics or math paper, you will typically include: (a) an Introduction (and possibly a brief Background section) to set the context, (b) the main Body of the paper where you develop the theory or proofs and present results, and (c) a Conclusion or Future Work section that discusses implications. Sketch out what points you’ll cover in each section. Determine the order of presentation that makes the argument most clear and compelling. It often helps to identify the central idea or result that everything builds toward, and ensure that the paper’s narrative is centered on that. Some authors recommend a “top-down” approach – start by writing a one-sentence statement of your main result (essentially a provisional abstract) and then expand the outline from there ￼ ￼. Also consider making a “storyboard” of any figures or equations: decide which figures, graphs, or key equations will illustrate your findings and in what sequence ￼. Organizing your thoughts in an outline will make the writing step much smoother and help you maintain a coherent flow.

9. Write a Compelling Introduction

The Introduction is critical – it sets the stage and convinces readers (and referees) that your work is important and novel. In this section, frame your research problem clearly. Start by describing the big picture: what is the broader field and why is the problem you address significant in that context? Then zoom in on the specific gap or open question that your paper tackles. Clearly state what was not understood or solved (the motivation). You should also briefly summarize relevant prior work here, to show that you’re aware of what’s been done and to highlight what’s missing. Essentially, the introduction (or a background section just before it) should answer the questions: “Why should someone read this paper? What is the problem, and what do we know about it so far? What gap or question remains?” ￼. After setting up the problem, state your contribution: explain how your paper addresses that gap. For example: “In this work, we propose a new model of X that resolves the discrepancy between Y and Z,” or “We prove a theorem that provides a unifying link between A and B, which were previously unrelated.” Make it explicit how your approach is different or new compared to past attempts. By the end of the introduction, the reader should understand what question you investigated, why it matters, and what main result or insight you are contributing. Keep the introduction relatively short (especially for a letter-style paper), but packed with the essential context and your paper’s purpose. This is also the place to hint at your findings – e.g. “As we will show, [Key Result] holds under [certain conditions], providing evidence that [implication].” A well-crafted introduction will grab the reader’s attention and pave the way for the technical sections.

10. Provide Necessary Theoretical Background or Model (if needed)

In a theoretical paper, you often need a section to lay out the framework or model you’re using, or any necessary background that wasn’t covered in the introduction. This could be titled “Background,” “Preliminaries,” or be part of the introduction in a short letter. The goal here is to equip the reader with any definitions, assumptions, or prior theoretical results they must know to understand your work. For example, you might describe the governing equations or foundational theorem that your work builds on. Keep this section concise and focused on what’s relevant to your story – don’t overload it with every detail of the field, only what the reader truly needs. It’s fine to assume the reader has a graduate-level understanding of the general area; you just need to highlight specifics they might not know or clarify notation and conventions. If your paper involves a new theoretical approach or a model, clearly describe it here. State your starting assumptions. If you’re extending a known model or theory, briefly summarize it and cite the original source. The guiding principle is to make the later presentation of results self-contained and logical: the reader shouldn’t get lost due to missing information. By the end of this part, the reader knows the playing field and is ready for your new contribution.

11. Present Your Methods and Results Clearly

This is the core “Body” of your paper where you detail your research work and findings. Structure this section in a logical sequence of steps or sub-sections. In mathematics, this is where you state your lemmas, theorems, and proofs; in physics, this is where you derive your key equations, describe analytic or computational methods, and present the outcome. Lead the reader through your argument or analysis step by step. It’s often effective to start by outlining the strategy (e.g. “We first derive X from the model, then apply Y to obtain Z.”). Present your main results prominently – for example, important theoretical results might be stated as a formal theorem or equation. Ensure that each major result is accompanied by either a proof (in math) or an explanation (in physics) so the audience can see how you reached it. If the full derivation is too long or technical to include, you can give a sketch of the proof or outline of the method in the main text and put detailed calculations in an Appendix or supplementary material. The key is that the logical flow is unbroken: each paragraph should follow from the previous, building the case for your conclusions. Use figures or diagrams if they help illustrate complex concepts – a well-chosen figure can convey your result at a glance (indeed, even very abstract results can often be summarized in a visual form ￼). Also, compare intermediate results with special cases or known results as you go along, to build trust that your new result makes sense. For example, “In the limiting case $\alpha \to 0$, our formula recovers the classic result of [Reference].” By doing this, you show the reader that your new results integrate well with existing knowledge. Throughout this section, maintain clarity: define any new notation, avoid unnecessary jargon, and keep sentences concise. This will make your groundbreaking results accessible to the readers (remember, even Physical Review Letters seeks papers “accessible for the general reader” in physics ￼). The emphasis should be on what you found that’s new and how you found it.

12. Discuss the Implications and Compare to Prior Work

After presenting the raw results, include a discussion of what they mean in the broader context. This can be a separate “Discussion” section or integrated into the conclusion. Here you interpret your findings: Why do they matter? How do they advance the field? Connect back to the problem outlined in the introduction: have you fully answered the research question? For theoretical work, you should also discuss how the results relate to or differ from previous studies. For example, “Unlike the result in [Smith, 2022], our solution does not require assuming linearity, and thus applies to a broader class of systems.” Be honest about what’s solved and what remains open. If there were any unexpected findings, mention them and any plausible explanations. It’s also valuable to highlight any limitations of your work (every study has some) – for instance, “This proof assumes differentiability; the case of non-differentiable functions remains to be examined.” By comparing your outcomes with earlier work, you demonstrate knowledge of the field and reinforce the novelty of your contribution (no one else achieved this result in quite this way). Additionally, discuss the implications: what are the consequences of your findings for theory or practice? Does it suggest that a certain theory needs revision, or does it open up a new avenue of research? In physics, a new theoretical result might suggest an experiment or predict a phenomenon; in math, it might solve a conjecture or enable new problems to be tackled. This section essentially tells readers why your result is significant and how it fits into the “big picture” of the field. As the world expert on your paper’s topic, you are in a unique position to guide others on how to think about these findings and what to do next ￼.

13. Conclude and Outline Future Work

Write a short Conclusion that encapsulates the main insights of the paper. The conclusion should briefly restate the problem or question and how your results have addressed it. For example: “In summary, we have demonstrated that [brief statement of main result], thereby resolving [the issue] and showing that [implication].” Keep it concise—one or two paragraphs is usually enough. This is your final message to the reader, so make it clear and confident. After summarizing, it’s common (especially in research letters or papers under 10 pages) to mention possible future work or open questions. Since research is an ongoing process, indicate what the next steps or remaining challenges are. For instance: “An open question remains regarding ___, which our approach could not address,” or “Future investigations might explore ___, building on our findings.” These suggestions show that you understand the broader landscape and are not over-claiming. It also can inspire other researchers. In fact, many classic papers end by pointing out questions that later become important research avenues ￼. However, be careful to strike a positive tone: highlight that your work advanced understanding while acknowledging there’s more to explore. By providing a roadmap for future research or practical applications, you extend the impact of your paper beyond its immediate results.

14. Craft a Strong Title and Abstract

Although the title and abstract appear at the top of the paper, it’s often best to refine them after you’ve written the main content (when you fully grasp the results and their significance). Title: Create a concise, informative title that captures both the context and the key result of your work ￼. The title should give readers a reason to read your paper. For example, instead of a vague title like “On Quantum Entanglement,” a stronger title might be “Violation of Bell’s Inequality in a 3-Particle System” – it provides specifics about what was done or found. A good title is also important for searchability (think of the keywords a researcher might use to find work like yours). Abstract: Write a one-paragraph abstract (usually 150–250 words) that summarizes the entire paper. The abstract should briefly state the problem or purpose of the study, outline the approach or methodology, and highlight the main result and conclusion. Importantly, state what is new or significant about your findings in the abstract, since many readers scan abstracts to decide if the work is worth reading. For example: “We introduce a new method for X and prove Y, which (for the first time) achieves Z. This result suggests that…”. Be explicit about novelty (some journals even ask authors to mention “This work is the first to…” or use phrases like “we report for the first time…”). Both title and abstract should be clear and enticing: they are essentially the advertisement for your paper to the world.

15. Revise for Clarity, Coherence, and Brevity

Now, revise and polish your draft. Good writing is rewriting. Go through each section and ensure the narrative is clear and logical. Check that the paper reads as a cohesive story, not just a collection of disconnected results. Clarity is paramount in scientific writing – this is the golden rule ￼. Strive for simple, direct language. For example, do your best to eliminate unnecessary jargon or overly long sentences. It often helps to have someone not in your immediate subfield read the paper; they should be able to grasp the main points without getting lost. Verify that all terms are defined and all assumptions stated. Make sure the notation is consistent throughout. Trim any fluff or off-topic discussion to meet length requirements and maintain focus. For instance, if a derivation or tangent doesn’t directly support your main thesis, consider moving it to an appendix or cutting it entirely. Top journals value conciseness: a shorter, well-written paper can have more impact than a lengthy, rambling one. In fact, a famous example is the shortest paper ever published in Physical Review Letters, which was about one page – every word counted. While you don’t need to be that extreme, do ask yourself for each paragraph, “Does this contribute to my main message?” If not, refine or remove it. Also ensure that the paper’s tone is scientific and objective; avoid grandiose claims that aren’t backed by evidence. During revision, double-check your figures and equations for clarity and correctness (labels, units, etc.), and make sure each figure or table is referenced in the text and explained. By the end of this step, your paper should be as clear and tight as possible, making it easy for others to appreciate the significance of your work.

16. Cite Sources Properly and Acknowledge Previous Work

As you finalize the text, ensure that all relevant prior work is cited and that you give credit wherever it’s due. This is both an ethical duty and a way to strengthen your paper’s credibility. Go through your draft and insert references for any statement of fact, theory, or prior result that is not originally yours. In the introduction and discussion especially, cite the key papers that relate to your work. Proper citation shows that you are knowledgeable about the field and helps situate your contribution relative to others’. If you’re building on a method or using data from someone else, acknowledge that. Different journals have different citation styles, but consistency and completeness are vital. Also, consider adding a brief related work paragraph if appropriate, to ensure the reader knows how your paper differs from specific closely related studies. Besides citations, include any acknowledgments (thanking funding sources or colleagues who provided feedback or assistance). Ensuring the references are in order (formatted correctly, all necessary ones included, no extraneous ones) is usually one of the last things to do before submission. A well-referenced paper demonstrates scholarly rigor and will make reviewers more confident that you’ve done your homework.

17. Get Feedback from Peers (Optional but Highly Recommended)

If time permits, have one or more colleagues (or your advisor, if you’re a student) read the nearly-final draft. Fresh eyes can catch unclear explanations, logical jumps, or even grammatical errors that you might overlook. You might also present your work internally (at a group meeting or seminar) before submission – often, explaining it to others reveals points that need clarification. Peer feedback can also alert you to any “so what?” issues – if a reader isn’t convinced the result is important, you may need to emphasize its significance more. Be open to constructive criticism and use it to improve the paper. It’s better to hear critiques now than from a journal referee later. Incorporate reasonable suggestions to make the paper stronger. This step, while not strictly required, often makes the difference between a good paper and a great paper.

18. Final Checks: Formatting, Proofreading, and Compliance

Before submission, do a final proofread of the entire paper. Look for typos, grammatical mistakes, or notation inconsistencies one last time. Ensure that your figures are of good quality and your captions are descriptive. Check that your paper meets the formatting guidelines of your target journal or preprint archive (e.g., length limits, required sections, reference style, etc.). For instance, if submitting to a journal like PRL, confirm that you’re within the 3750-word (or 4-page) limit and that the abstract and references are formatted as they require ￼. Sometimes journals have templates – use them to avoid format issues. Verify that all citations in the text have a corresponding entry in the reference list and vice versa. It’s also a good idea to make sure your title and abstract still perfectly reflect your final paper (tweaking them if necessary for accuracy or punchiness). Finally, prepare any additional materials the journal might require: a cover letter (often highlighting why your result is significant and novel), suggested reviewers, or supplementary files (if you have lengthy proofs or data). When you’re satisfied that everything is in order, you’re ready to submit your paper.

19. (Post-Submission) Be Prepared to Iterate

This is slightly beyond writing the paper, but important: If the journal sends back reviewer comments, be prepared to revise and respond. Treat the review process as an extension of writing – a chance to further improve clarity or address any concerns. Even great papers often go through a round or two of revisions. Stay focused on the goal of communicating your novel result as clearly and convincingly as possible. Eventually, with persistence and careful work, your paper will be accepted and published, contributing new knowledge to physics or mathematics!

⸻

Following this checklist will help ensure that your paper is truly novel, well-structured, and clear. By identifying a genuine research gap, focusing tightly on a single significant result, and writing with precision, you increase the chances that your work will not only be accepted in a reputable journal but also remembered by readers. Many of the most famous papers in physics and math stand out because they introduced a new idea or solved a longstanding problem in a concise, lucid way. By emulating these principles – thorough literature review, pinpointing a gap, robust methodology, and crisp writing – you’ll be on the path to producing a paper worthy of that tradition. Good luck with your research and writing!
